Brief Description: 
Here, its running cucumber tests independently of Rails, just using Rake
----------------------------------
----------------------------------

How To Use:

[Step#1] if your Ruby-Binary is accessed by anything other than 'ruby' i.e. say if it's 'jruby' or you tend to use it by some other ruby-vm...
edit 'Fcuke.rb' and replace the value of 'RUBY_BIN' with the name applicable to your ruby.

[Step#2] place all your Cucumber related files at their relative location in "./features" directory
   + Feature Files in "./features/"
   + Step Definitions in "./features/step_definitions/"
   + "paths.rb" in "./features/support/"
   + and so on
   So, the "./features" directory in here is supposed to contain entire Cucumber generated structure

[Step#3] Execute "Fcuke.rb", it will run cucumber tests for all features and store the output in "twrak.log".
On every execution of 'Fcuke.rb", the earlier log gets wiped off.
